Because this project is made in Android Studio it isn't as simple as just typing 'cargo run' into the console. 
The best instructions I can give are to install and setup android studio, download the code as a zip file. 
Unzip and open the folder in Android Studio, and from there you should be able to click the green arrow on the top right of the screen. 
I apologise for the lack of instructions, i'm very new to android studio, and had some trouble even getting my end to run so I don't think I can be of much help.
With this being said I do understand this is kind of unfair, because there's no way for you guys to tell if my code works at all, so I am willing to get into a call with you guys at any point to either try to assist in the setup, or to show the code and app running on my end and answer any questions you guys may have.

Sorry again for the lack of instructions
If there are any questions the best place to contact me is on discord : Banksy#7721
i'd be happy to hop into a call at any time to talk about my project and how to get it setup on your end, or prove that it works properly on my end.

Another alternative is to run the lib.rs file that I have inside a rust playground and just call the methods directly from a main method. 
I'm working on getting a more friendly version of this into a file that I'll upload to here, so that the functionality of the app can be better understood without
the hassle of android studio
