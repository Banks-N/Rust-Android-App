## Project Introduction : 

My idea for the project is to create an app that will allow me to track workouts and exercises aswell as display
progress for those exercises and workouts. Here are my goals and objectives for the project: 
 - Have a fast and efficient GUI to enter in exercises (aswell as sets/reps/weight).
 - Track progress on certain exercises such as squat and benchpress.
 - Store this information somewhere
 - Access this information and display the history of an exercise and the progress that's been made with it.
I've chosen to work on this project because this has been something that's been on my mind for the past few months, and I do want to make it happen.
I've recently started working out consistenly, and have a crude spreadsheet where I log my exercises and progress, and it'd be nice to have an easier way to do this.

## Technical Overview :

Checkpoint 1 : Working app with a GUI 
Checkpoint 2 : GUI where you can enter exercises in and that information is saved
Final : Working app where you can enter in exercises, aswell as view progress on existing exercises

Firstly I would need to make a working app, this could be a windows app or an android app I'm not sure which one to go with right now, but i'm hoping i can
get it to work on the phone. 
Next I need to design a GUI that lets the user input an exercise aswell as certain information regarding it (sets,reps,weight)
I need to store this information somewhere, maybe in a struct or database
Have a different GUI where you can select an exercise that is in the database/struct
Display the history of this exercises, and perhaps an overview of how much progress has been made (hopefully a graph of the history, and maybe how much you've moved up in weight)



## Challenges:
Creating an app with rust
Implementing user friendly GUI's
Creating structs and functions that work together efficiently and correctly
Storing the information locally, and having it save somwhere so that the next time the app is opened it's not lost
Displaying a graph / summary of the exercises
